Mailroom is a framework that simplifies the creation, routing, and delivery of user notifications based on events from external systems.

![Flow diagram](./docs/flow.png)

Mailroom is designed to be flexible and extensible, allowing you to easily add new handlers and transports as your needs grow and evolve. Simply write a function to transform incoming events into notifications, and Mailroom will take care of the rest, including:

- Acting as the primary notification relay for incoming webhooks from external systems
- Sending notifications to the appropriate users based on their preferences (e.g. PR reviews go to email, but build failures go to Slack)
- Formatting notifications for different transports (e.g. email, Slack, etc.)
- Matching usernames, emails, IDs, etc. across different systems
- Logging, error handling, retries, and more

See [`internal/example.go`](./internal/example.go) for an example of how to use mailroom.
